## Shit AI Art Critics would say...

This is a simple test project that uses the [MobileNet Image Classifier](https://ml5js.org/reference/api-ImageClassifier/) from [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) to generate an AI art citique for an uploaded image. 

Once the image is uploaded, MbileNet tries to classify the images. For each image it returns three different classes, which are then used to construct the first sentence.

In addition, for the second sentence a random "bullshit" art critique statement is generated. The content of the random sentences is borrowed from [this great project by Pixmaven](http://www.pixmaven.com/phrase_generator.html).
